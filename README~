2. internals.c
3. utilities.c
4. .history
5. makefile
6. pHeader.h
7. tempFile.txt(MAY OR MAY NOT)
8. my_shell (EXECUTABLE)

FULFILLED FUNCTIONALITES:
-------------------------
1. Execute all the commands (ls, clear, vi etc.)[SUCCESS]
---> All external Commands are running properly after forking new process.

2. cd, pwd, export[SUCCESS]
----> Internal Commands are handled , for this I have defined seperate functions in the
      the internal.c .

3. Set environment variables stored in configuration file “.shellrc”[SUCCESS]
----> I have made one .AvgRc(hidden file) which is always loaded at the time of my shell initializations
      this file is read line by line and all the linea are actually the commands that can run using the 
      processData().Enviornment variable can be set .

4. Print environment variables using echo command[SUCCESS]
----> One can easily print the enviornment variables set at the time of the shell initializations, also
      user can set the enviornment variable using the export command and later on print them.

5. Redirection operators < , > , << , >>[SUCCESS]
----> All redirecton operators are working alongside each other in a fine way, for implemnting the << operator
      I have created an file tempfile and that file is then set as the input stream.

6. Support for history and '!' operator[SUCCESS]
----> history is stored in a .history file line by line , which is displayed using the history command, ! operator also
      ! followed by the interger ,negative integer and the command, if command is not present in the history it actually 
      prints the error message else it displays the most recent one ,this is being done by the 2D array and file handling.

7. Pipes “|” (multiple)[SUCCESS]
----> Mutiple pipes with all external commands and implemented internal Commands are workign fine.

8. Background and foreground functionality : &, fg[SUCCESS]
---->both & and fg <PID> is implemented successfully

Note :  Commands which are input, after you change the current dir are not reflected in the history , as the .histrory file is
        made locally , same could be said for the .AvgRc file(shell config file).

thank you
